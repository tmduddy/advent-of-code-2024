### how 2 run
```shell
npm run day:new <number>
```
will create a new directory in the days folder with the provided number and fetch the input data.

You'll need a session cookie taken from a recently logged in browser session on adventofcode to accomplish this.

This also creates a `demo.txt` file that holds on to any demo data from the problem. 

```shell
npm run day:demo <number>
```

will execute the given day with demo data instead of the "real" input


```shell
npm run day <number>
```
will execute the given day with the proper puzzle input.

to just build the files and copy over the input data use

```shell
npm run compile
```

or 

```shell
./build.sh
```
