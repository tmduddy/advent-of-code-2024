## haskell??

I say every year that I'm going to try to do this in Haskell and finally this year I'm trying. 

I haven't learned the software-ization side of things yet so load the data the same way you would for the TS approach (into `./days/day<x>/input.txt`) and then cd into the `./haskell` dir (this one) and do a `runhaskell <file>`
